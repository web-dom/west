# West🌵
My super simple tester for web assembly. It iterates through every exported function that starts with `test` and calls the function.

* if it returns 0, it assumes the test passes
* if it returns non-zero, it assumes the test failed and the value represents the start of a C-string saying what went wrong

Just create an `index.html`
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@web-dom/west@latest/west.js"></script>
<script>
  west("test.wasm");
</script>
```

See a demo [here](https://web-dom.github.io/west/)

# What if I have other imports

Other imports can be mocked out to do whatever you like with an additional argument:

```javascript
west("test.wasm",{
  my_imported_function(){
    //do nothing during tests
  });
```

# What about a CLI?

TBD
